#### **Inspiration**:
Every day over 100 Americans die from opioid overdose. We intend for this app to help reduce that number and give bystanders a chance to save lives. Ambulances are often more than 4 minutes away, which is the time limit of brain death after someone stops breathing.

#### **What it does:**
Our app helps to increase survival rate of overdoses by facilitating the communication between someone reporting the incident and people nearby who are either CPR certified/ can administer Narcan. These people can register on the app and they will receive alerts and location information when someone nearby, within a given radius, presses the "Send Help" button.
